### Description

A portal where users can effortlessly search and discover their MEGO NFT tickets. This dapp leverages the MEGO subgraph, acting as a window into the rich data behind those tickets. With a few clicks, users can find their specific event based on _Tier_, _Token ID_, e.t.c, instantly pulling up all their relevant MEGO NFTs. No more digging into blockchain explorer and getting lost â€“ just a seamless experience powered by The Graph!
